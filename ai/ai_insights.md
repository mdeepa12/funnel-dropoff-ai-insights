# 🤖 AI-Assisted Insights & Recommendations (2024 Funnel)

## Summary of Findings
- The funnel shows the largest drop-off in the middle steps (Product View → Add to Cart), which is common in e-commerce journeys.
- Drop-off tends to be higher for certain segments (device/region), suggesting UX or performance differences.

## Hypothesis (Why drop-off happens)
- Add to Cart friction: unclear CTA, long scroll, missing key info (price/shipping), or slow page load.
- Mobile usability: smaller screen, slower network, more interruptions.
- Region differences: language/localization, payment availability, shipping constraints.

## Recommended Actions (Prioritized)
1. **Improve Add-to-Cart UX**
   - Make CTA more prominent, reduce steps, show shipping/price earlier
2. **Performance improvements on mobile**
   - Reduce page load time, optimize images, lazy load below the fold
3. **Reduce checkout friction**
   - Guest checkout, simpler forms, improve payment success rate
4. **Run targeted experiments**
   - A/B test CTA placement, product page layout, or simplified checkout

## Next Experiment Ideas
- Test “sticky Add to Cart” button on mobile
- Test simplified product page layout (shorter page, clearer value)
- Test fewer checkout fields / autofill
